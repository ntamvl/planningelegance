                                very detail-oriented and motivate, I was able to input my unique ideas, years of experience, and

                <p class="wht-fnt">Working in the Wedding Industry is definitely very fulfilling, and amazing to be a
                    part
                    of. Being able to help couples start the beginning of their lives together is a feeling that is most
                    enduring to engage with. Being a wedding planner in California also allows you to participate in
                    events
                    that are not part of the traditional Wedding Industry. Recently, we had the amazing opportunity to
                    work
                    with the CW’s 90210 Production Team and the experience was so much fun from beginning to end. From
                    sitting in on production meetings to guiding the cast and crew on filming days, I was very fortunate
                    to
                    be a part of the 90210 team for several weeks. This 90210 season finale was aired on Monday, May 16,
                    2011.</p>

                <h2 class="no-margin-left">Planning Elegance’s Involvement</h2>

                <p class="wht-fnt">Planning Elegance was approached by one of the producers of 90210. We were asked to
                    play
                    the role of technical advisor to the 90210 production team in some of the South Asian Hindu Ceremony
                    aspects of the season finale. We jumped on the opportunity and decided to fit the 90210 meeting and
                    filming schedule into our schedule by collaborating as a team.</p>

                <p class="wht-fnt">I was personally involved in the entire process. Using my strong background in
                    wedding
                    planning and coordination, I was easily able to give the directors, producers, and writers of the
                    show
                    advice and direction on certain South Asian traditions and cultures. Hired as a Technical Advisor, I
                    participated in production meetings, director meetings, as well as filming days to help guide the
                    directors to reach their goal of creating an authentic Indian Wedding – attention to detail is what
                    they
                    strove for.</p>
