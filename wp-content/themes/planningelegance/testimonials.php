                    I hired Mili 3 months before my wedding. I guess the 1 regret I have is not hiring her from the start!!! Mili was BEYOND AMAZING! I am totally type-a and would send her 1000 emails a day with all my scattered thoughts... and she would respond to EVERY SINGLE EMAIL! She would help me sort through all my wants/must-haves to get to where I really wanted to be for my wedding. Needless to say, she is incredibly patient! Also, she was great at involving my parents so that everyone's vision was heard, and then she would find solutions on how to get me what I wanted, while respecting other people's opinions. She was so organized throughout the planning process which was reflected on the day of! everything went off without a hitch! everyone at my wedding complimented me on how well organized the wedding was, and how everything flowed so well.</p>
                    
<p>I also love how she would give me her honest opinion (without being mean) when I asked for it. She has an eye for what looks good and what will work, so having her give me her true opinion, versus what I want to hear, really made decision making a lot easier as well.
Moral of the Story: HIRE Planning Elegance! They are definitely worth every penny, and more!</p>

                    Planning Elegance is an amazing team to work with during the tedious process of wedding planning. Mili and her team of experts were absolutely fantastic.  She was very helpful in taking over multiple tasks, including contacting my vendors and finalizing all details, helping me format the sequence of events for the reception program, providing a very detailed and organized wedding/reception timeline, and most importantly being attentive to my personal needs and making sure she always responded in a timely manner in which she ALWAYS DID! I also loved the fact that on the day of the wedding she had an assistant constantly with me and my bridesmaids and she made sure all of our needs were taken care of. Mili and her team definitely made our wedding day a very smooth and effortless process. Thank you for everything. We appreciated it! Plus, we enjoyed the marvelous shots you were able to capture</p>

                    Our daughter got married a month ago and Mili and her team helped us coordinate her 550 guest wedding as well as 350 guest henna ceremony. Many friends who attended the events have said to me that I looked so calm and happy at the wedding and that 'I' should be a wedding coordinator, a testament to Mili's work.</p>
<p>I will admit that I was initially a bit skeptical about hiring a wedding coordinator. After all, I had done parties with several hundred people at our house so how different could a wedding be? Wrong, think again.</p>

<p>Mili was instrumental in helping me mainitain my sanity through the weding week and there were several instances where she positively saved the day. The biggest one being that when the wedding day dawned, bright and sunny, she texted me the hour-by-hour weather forecast at 7:00 a.m and even though I was hesitant she (thankfully) convinced me to move the ceremony indoors. Sure enough, it started pouring just after the barat arrived and the ceremony began!</p>

<p>Mili is calm, pleasant, dedicated and professional. She goes the extra mile and takes care of all the detais (and there are a zillion details!) on the big day so you can relax and actually enjoy the event. I would strongly recommend her to a friend and gladly rehire her when my other kids are getting married.</p>

                    Mili and her team were absolutely incredible.  Prior to the big day, Mili was very organized and made sure to collect all the information she needed in a professional and dependable manner. She took active notes during our conversations and I could trust that every detail would be taken care of. She made the extra effort to meet me in person, and used her experience to provide guidance on how the day will flow. She definitely brought lots of excellent ideas to the table that we might not have otherwise considered.</p>

<p>On the day of the wedding, Mili and her team were 100% on. They dealt with issues, made sure all the vendors were on time, and the details were right. She made sure our families knew where they needed to be, and would have refreshments ready for them when they got there. Multiple members of my family commented on how amazing it was to have her - everyone could enjoy the festivities without a worry. It was fantastic.</p>

                    Planning Elegance did a spectacular job with my wedding and during the months leading up to it. I worked with Mili who was an absolute pleasure. She was on point with everything, very responsive, and always had suggestions and solutions for any and all of my planning needs. On the day of my wedding, I didn't wait longer than a blink before my needs were met. My entire family was relaxed and was able to enjoy the events to their fullest. My assigned Planning Elegance team worked tirelessly to ensure that my husband, our families, and our guests had the most memorable experience! I couldn't speak more highly of Planning Elegance and I encourage everyone to use them. I am a very particular, type A individual, and I am still amazed at how Planning Elegance not only met my exceedingly high standards, but they surpassed them, as well.</p>

                    Working with Mili was a wonderful experience. She’s friendly, easy to talk to, and most importantly, organized!  We had a wedding/reception on a larger scale at around 900 people, which was a huge undertaking for any one person to plan. She made herself available at all hours by phone and email and would even tell us when she would be out of the office at other weddings so we wouldn’t panic when we couldn't get a hold of her.</p>

<p>Something we valued greatly was how honest we were able to be with Mili throughout the planning process. It’s crazy to think how well Mili got to know us and there were even times where she would help us sort out our own "creative" differences. She was able to keep us on track with our budget.  Mili and her company have a lot of experience and have a great reputation in the business.</p>

<p>When it came to the day of, Mili and her team were able to make sure everything went off without a hitch. It seems like there are hundreds of different moving parts to a wedding and reception, and we couldn't have imagined coordinating all of those things ourselves.  We highly recommend Mili and her team! Thanks so much for making our wedding events such a success!</p>

They are so well prepared and kept us very close to schedule, which is a feat for Indian weddings! I didn't have to worry about a thing the day of and I was able to enjoy everything.</p>

                    Planning Elegance was our favorite and most pleasant vendor to work with. Book them ... They go above and beyond, they are very service orientated. U won't regret it!</p>

<p>Planning Elegance stood out to us against other wedding planners due to their speedy, kind and personal response to our initial inquiry.  Mili is very diligent and excellent! In addition, she is very personable, understanding and compassionate. She helped recommend vendors to us without being pushy and always soothed our nerves. Mili and Amy planned detailed vendor meetings for us. We threw Mili a few last minute curve balls, and she made it happen no questions asked. We saw and spoke to Mili more than anyone else at our wedding. She is so hands on.  She tied all loose ends to make it all come together perfectly. Most importantly, guests complimented us on how professional and excellent she was!</p>

<p>Without a doubt Mili and her team at Planning Elegance is our number one vendor recommendation. Trust us ... She will not let you down! and it was sad to say good bye at the end. </p>

                    Where do I start? I'm not even sure how I came across Amy, but am so lucky that I did. I had a fusion Hindu-Christian ceremony, and could not have pulled off the event without her.</p>

<p>Just a few words to describe her: Professional, Unbelievably Organized, Calming (and brides do need someone that lets them know everything will be ok) persistent in dealings with the venue and other vendors, and her follow-up is impeccable down to every spreadsheet and document she provided. She did all of this while maintaining her pleasant demeanor and shared her abundance of knowledge in wedding planning and events...well, I can go on and on, but to say Amy was a great addition to my vendors would be an understatement. She went above and beyond what I expected and handled every situation with finesse. Both families as well as myself and my groom were so happy with her and will recommend her to others without hesitation. She made the days up to the wedding run smoothly and the grand event go on without any hiccups. To say the least, she was one of my unofficial bridesmaids by the end of our beautiful day and while it sounds silly, I will miss our calls and meetings tremendously...so much that I am trying to get her to extend her services of wedding planning to baby planning as well, haha ;)  5 stars, A+, amazing planner</p>

                    We would like to express our sincere appreciation for the services provided by Mili Shah as the Event Coordinator for the wedding of our daughter Megha. This was the first wedding in our family and the first Indian wedding at the hotel where our daughter was getting married. There were many unknowns and we were afraid that we would lose control of some of the wedding events. To our pleasant surprise, all of the events took place just as planned. We and our guests were simply amazed at how smoothly everything went. Much of the credit for this goes to Mili, who was able to get all the vendors associated with our daughter’s wedding to work as a team. Mili worked very hard and was always there when we needed her. We would strongly recommend her to any of our friends looking for Event Coordinator.</p>

                    Amy and her assistants were very productive and on top of everything. Usually brides get stressed out because they worry that things won't go according to their thorough planning, but having Amy there takes care of that worry, which makes your day even more special. I would highly recommend her to every South Asian bride because she not only takes over all the little stressful things, but she also gets you in touch with the best vendors according to your budget.</p>

                   So I am thoroughly convinced that the technology to clone human beings has not only been invented, it's been perfected. Throughout the evening of our wedding there were roughly 27 Amy Patels running around with 27 clip boards and 27 wireless headsets. Sure this might sound a little crazy, but really this is the only explanation I can offer up. When people are good at what they do, it's usually because they care about the result. Your passion for your work shines through in every single calculated gesture. I will recommend your services for life. You were cut out for this type of work. I mean it is afterall, your middle name. - Mohammed Ali</p>
                   <p>Sooooo.... i honestly don't feel like thank you is enough! You did a FANTASTIC job! My mom is seriously your biggest fan and my brother has nothing but respect for you. I'm so happy to have found you! =) - Rehana (Vhora) Ali</p>

                    We had Amy start helping us several months before the wedding. She kept us on track so that we had everything organized on a timeline. She was always easy to reach by phone or email and even in person! She helped us coordinate the vendors; our hotel coordinator was please with how prepared our vendors were. On the day of the wedding, it was and cold outside and she moved the wedding indoors without any delay in our wedding. Our friends and family have told me that they were so impressed how our organized our event was and that it was the best wedding they had ever attended. We were impressed because we had so much fun at our own wedding...We would highly recommend Amy and her team.</p>

                    I was referred to Amy by a friend, and am ever so grateful to have found her. I decided I needed a coordinator less than one month before my wedding, and Amy was able and willing to be flexible with my timeline, budget and various needs. From start to finish, she was great to work with. Her professionalism impressed me from the get go, as she responded to my online inquire almost immediately and had a final contract available within just days. She helped me tie a major loose end - less than one month before the wedding I didn't have a florist I was happy with; Amy found one with a beautiful portfolio and a creative mind. In the days leading up to the wedding, it comforted me wonders to know I was working with somebody who knew weddings so well. We had a mixed Scottish-Pakistani wedding, with a mix of guests from different backgrounds and faiths. Amy was able to help us iron out the fine details from the interfaith wording of our ceremony, to the seating and everything in between. Her presence brought things together, without infringing on the uniqueness and DIY approaches we were striving for. It was a pleasure working with Amy, and I would strongly recommend her to anybody planning a wedding. There's only so much a bride should stress about handling, the details should be left to professionals.</p>

                    First off, Amit and I want to thank Amy Patel and the Planning Elegance team for making our events as successful as they were!! :)</p>

<p>Amit and I set out to do what seemed like the impossible - a Hindu wedding, a Sikh wedding and a reception all in one day and at two different locations. We knew we would need help aside from family to keep the day from going haywire. We had met a few coordinators before I met Amy. My connection with her was instant as her warm personality, her strong work-ethic and her commitment to her job shined through in our first meeting. Amit and I had a vision on how we wanted to see the day play out but that meant we needed to be extremely detail oriented and work with someone who could understand what we needed - Amy was that person.</p>

<p>Amy was always available to us by any form of communication at any time of the day. She never pushed us into choosing any specific vendor and always provided insightful suggestions. Luckily for us we had Amy's entire team on hand on the day of the wedding and they were able to flawlessly work with our fabulous vendors. We and our families were able to enjoy all of our events without worrying about any of the details.</p>

<p>Amy is a true gem - her dedication to her job and her clients is evident from all the events she has coordinated and the many long lasting relationships she has maintained. We are so fortunate to say that not only can we call Amy, our wedding planner; but a new lifetime friend.
Wishing you much continued success Planning Elegance!!</p>

                   Hiring Planning Elegance to coordinate our wedding was one of the best decisions we made for the wedding. Initially, we were hesitant to get a coordinator, wondering whether it would really help us in the end, but we quickly realized what an asset Amy and her staff were to us. She handled all the vendor information, made detailed itineraries of each event, and paid all the staff at the end of the night. During the event, she handled all the logistics, allowing us to actually enjoy the party! I highly recommend Planning Elegance! It's definitely money and time well spent!‎ </p>

                    Saman and I wanted to thank you so much for making both our Mehndi and Wedding so perfect. Having you there with us allowed us to really enjoy our wedding, and made it so much more memorable. Customizing a wedding package for us and maintaining constant communication with us made us feel at ease during the last month and on the wedding day, which is usually the most stressful time of the process.</p>

<p>Creating a wedding package for our specific needs was the best part. You never forced services on us, and you made a genuine effort to understand our needs and concerns, while staying mindful of our budget. It really made you our personal wedding planning, rather than just someone helping coordinate our wedding. In such a personal time of our lives, it was comforting to know we had someone behind who was so determined to make these nights special for us.</p>

<p>I also appreciated the constant communication you maintained with us. We always felt like we knew the status of our inquiries, and you always stayed on top of everything to ensure the Mehndi and Wedding went according to plan. You were always open to our emails or phone calls throughout the day, and even late at night. You also accepted our last minute changes without hesitation. On the day of the Mehndi and the Wedding, our family and friends told us they really appreciated how nice and polite you were to them, and were very impressed with how professionally you coordinated both events. Thanks again for all of your help over the past several weeks, and we'll miss working with you.</p>

                    Dear Planning Elegance,<br>
Thank you so much for helping put together our dream wedding. Your team was always so professional and helpful from the very beginning and I have nothing but positive things to say! From the planned organizational meetings to the frantic day-of phone calls your team was always on top of it and managed everything in a calm collected manner. We always felt comfortable that everything was running on schedule and being taken care of, especially on the day of the wedding which was a huge relief and allowed us to actually enjoy our wedding day! I think the best part of planning elegance is their ability to customize your wedding based on your preferences, budget, culture, values, etc without forcing you in any direction. It is obvious that Planning Elegance values their clients and dedicates all the time & energy needed to get every detail perfect! Thank you again!!</p>

                   Planning Elegance - and in particular owner Amy Patel - was essential in making my wedding day an amazing success. We hired Amy about 8 months before our big day, and although our venue was already secured, she gave us great recommendations on DJ's, decor, linens, and bridal beauty services. Amy helped us evaluate our proposals and negotiate the best price with our vendors. Her expertise in South Asian weddings and the ceremonies and unique rituals associated with them was essential. Amy is very organized and kept us on task with booking our vendors and making key decisions. On the day of, Amy and her staff kept everything running smoothly and as a result, the event was a huge success. People are still talking about our wedding almost 2 months later!</p>

                    THANK YOU for a beautiful job! I have certainly missed our conversations and I would not have been able to get through that weekend or my three months before it in planning without your help. I really appreciate what you have done for me and I will always keep you in mind for any one who ever wants a more than elegant wedding!</p>

                   Sonia and I loved working with Amy. She was straight-forward and she helped us make decisions by making everything very simple and gave a ton of information about all the places to have our wedding.</p>
<p>They helped me so much with my wedding! I didn't have to lift a finger because Amy and her team were there for everything for my wedding. I would recommend them to everyone and I think all brides need a wedding planner so you can have fun at your wedding</p>
